<h2>Wrestling career</h2>
<div class="twothirds">
<p>Dwayne johnson made his wrestling debut on march 10, 1996, at age 24. His ring name was Rocky Maivia,
    honouring both his father and grandfather who were both wrestlers. He was first presented as heroic 
    and a good guy, but fans were not liking it so they started booing him. This lead to him transforming
    into a more confident and cocky guy we know today: The Rock. From 1997-2000 The Rock was growing rapidly,
    quickly becoming a fan favourite. This is the time period when he started developing catchphrases. His
    most famous is "If you smell what the rock is cooking!" Which is one of the most recognizable in WWE
    History. The rock's last time wrestling was in april of 2024, during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XL">wrestlemania 40.</a>
